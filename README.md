# Welcome to my profile!!!

My name is Julian. 

I am a man who loves Malta very much. 

I love Malta so much, I created:

- [Maltese Archipelago Information](https://github.com/ragelmalti/Maltese-Archipelago-Website) - A website dedicated to the island of Malta. Contains numerous original articles, written by me and my friend [Zach](https://github.com/Zaxtrz), as well as web resources, to help people learn about Malta.
- [Maltese to English Dictionary](https://github.com/ragelmalti/Maltese-to-English-Dictionary) - A Maltese language to English dictionary, that can be viewed offline. The dictionary is continually evolving, with new words being added all the time!

If you have an ideas or suggestions, feel free to contribute to my projects!
